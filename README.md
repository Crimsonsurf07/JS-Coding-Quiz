                               Tony’s JavaScript Coding Quiz

					Summary

For this assignment we were not provided with any starter code and had to design this from scratch. This always opens up a multitude of possibilities and creativity options to explore. We were provided with a Mock-Up of the project to use as a reference for what our final product should resemble. The question and answer choices were of our own choosing.

This assignment was challenging in ways I honestly wasn’t expecting. Throughout the project and utilizing dev tools I was able to to fix any bugs I had written into the code. I think I may have created this project at least a dozen times each progressively better than the previous version. I like to push myself with the knowledge I have and I utilized a bunch of different reference material as much as possible to assist me with completing this project into a functioning quiz.







Below is a screenshot of my JavaScript Coding Quiz with the Time, High Scores link, as the quiz instructions. Once the user click the start button the quiz will begin!
